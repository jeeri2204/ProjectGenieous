# ProjectGenieous

What is your big idea? With Covid-19 terrorizing the world, many countries are under lockdown. Fortunately, most of the IT industry is managing their work from home. However, this is causing lot of inconvenience and difficulties such as power cuts, poor bandwidth of internet and handling kids while working. Think of a VI Admin trying to monitor a customer setup from home and as he is about to trigger some live diagnostics, internet goes off. Due to above reasons if the VI admin fails to take action on any particular vSphere issues it can lead to loss of productivity of a Developer, disruption for production setups or even loss of money if it is a VMC setup.  To avoid such things and help our vSphere admins of customers and VMC alike, we propose Genieous. Genious is an advanced bot, whom you can talk to via your cell phone, say slack. Genieous will inform you about daily status and any critical scenarios. But that is not where it stops. You can tell Genieous to take a corrective action immediately and it will help you rectify the issues in no time.ï¿½

This was an internal project collaborated with other people from VMware. Hence for the refernce you will just find a slack sample code(sampleSlackMessageCode.py) which is used as a trigger.
